# Tricky Kotlin #0: extension constructor

This is a series of Kotlin tricks.

As we all know, Kotlin supports something called `extension methods`, which means you can add some methods to some existing classes.

In this Kata, you should make some `extension constructor`.

.For example
 You can add a constructor to kotlin.Int that accepts a String and parse the string to int.

You should add such extension constructor to `kotlin.Int`, `kotlin.Long`, `kotlin.Double`.
